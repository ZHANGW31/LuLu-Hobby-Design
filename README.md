This repository will hold all of the designs, sketches, mock-ups and diagrams for my project LuLuHobby

**LuLu Hobby**
**Description**\
The idea is to connect people through shared hobbies using digital media, such as short videos, and image posts. With LuLu Hobby, you will have a personal profile to showcase all of your personal hobbies. You can see all fellow hobbyists in your local area by looking at a local feed. You may sort and filter your feed to be specific hobbies , or you may also use the explore option to see all hobbies participated in your local area.
